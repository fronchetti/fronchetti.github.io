<p>Computer Science is correlated with mathematics, a subject I always found challenging. My passion for computers, however, guided me to discover alternative ways to learn mathematical concepts and get things done. Today, I apply these same learning strategies to teach Computer Science. My classes embrace active learning methodologies, where students take center stage, guided by the principle that "<i>the one who speaks the most is the one learning."</i></p>
