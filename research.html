<p>I always loved social sciences as much as I love computers and technology. In my research studies, I try to explore a mixture of both worlds. My main research interests lie in the areas of Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics. Humans at first, always!</p>

<h3>Current topics</h3>
<ul class="custom-list">
    <li><b>Supporting open-source development:</b> Open-source communities are known for supporting many software applications. From system-related
        programs such as the Linux Kernel to programming languages like Python, open-source development plays an essential role in the software industry. While propriety software depends on the hiring of employees in a company-based
        model, open-source communities benefit from collaborations from both employees and volunteers. The critical challenge to keep such communities alive is to gather sufficient workforce. As most open-source projects are primarily
        available online, the gateway to these projects tends to be their websites and coding repositories, where limited support is available. As a researcher on the topic, my goal is to investigate  ways to support
        contributors in open-source communities.
    </li>
    <li><b>Robot programming and interaction:</b> Robot sales are increasing year after year. Economics experts explain the dramatic and continued uptick in
        robotics by a change in the mindset of manufacturers, who are now automating a broader set of tasks than ever before. Many hardware advancements in robot
        technology allowed such robots to become reliable, but the corresponding software support has lagged behind, and the problems this created soon became obvious. Most programming languages are too complex for novices, programming environments do not benefit from more advanced solutions in computer science, and software engineering principles are not applied in most companies. On this matter, my research applies the knowledge created in years of software engineering and human-computer interaction to improve the software-side of robotics.
        Among the solutions I have been working on are beginner-friendly solutions that allow users without experience in robotics to program industrial robots, and studies on how to improve programming-related tasks using technologies such as augmented reality devices.

<p><b>Note:</b> My complete name is Luiz Felipe Fronchetti Dias. When I started as a researcher, I didn't know I could choose what names I wanted to show on my papers. For this reason, you may find old papers where my name is Luiz Felipe Dias instead of Felipe Fronchetti.</p>
