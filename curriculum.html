<p>One day my mother looked at me and said: "<i>Felipe, I don't know what you want to be in life, but if you decide to be an educator like me, find a professor at your university and show them your desire for research</i>." A few weeks later, a professor offered me a voluntary job in his laboratory. From that day on, I never stopped researching.</p>
